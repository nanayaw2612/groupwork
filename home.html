        <p> <strong>Eastern Region:</strong>
            The Eastern Region, especially in areas like Akyem and Nsutam, also faces significant challenges with illegal mining.
            <br> The activities here often involve small-scale miners who work without permits,
             <br>leading to environmental degradation and loss of farmland.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Ashanti Region:</strong>
            The Ashanti Region is one of the major hotspots for illegal mining. 
            <br>It is home to both legal and illegal gold mining operations, especially in districts like Obuasi, where gold deposits are abundant.
            <br> Many illegal miners work in and around these areas, often engaging in small-scale mining without the proper licenses.
         </p>

             <stong>Western Region:</stong>
              The Western Region, particularly the Western North and Western South districts, has been heavily affected by illegal mining activities.
              <br> Towns such as Prestea, Tarkwa, and the surrounding areas have seen widespread illegal mining.<br> These regions are rich in gold resources, <br>
               making them prime locations for both legal and illegal mining
         </p>

            Western North Region
            Located in the southwestern part of Ghana, the Western North Region has also become a major site for illegal mining.<br>
            The region's gold-rich areas like Sefwi Wiawso have attracted numerous illegal miners, resulting in deforestation,<br>
             water contamination, and other environmental issues. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Brong-Ahafo(Bono) Region:</strong>

             particularly in districts like Kenyasi. <br>Illegal miners have flocked to these areas due to the abundance of gold.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Region (and North East Region):</strong>
            While less commonly associated with illegal mining compared to the southern regions,
            <br>parts of the Northern Region, especially around the Bole and Mamprusi areas, <br>
             have seen some illegal mining activities, particularly for gold.
